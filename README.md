Personal Website/Blog

Description
This project is a personal website/blog where I share information about myself, my interests, hobbies, and skills. Using Next.js and RTK for the frontend, Docker for containerization, PostgreSQL for the database, and DBeaver for database management, I have created a platform where I will soon release pages with articles. Users will be able to comment on and share the content.
